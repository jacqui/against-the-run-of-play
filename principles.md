# Key principles

## Narrative 'Things' are core to the experience.
In the case of football, these are:
  - Primary things:
    - Match
    - Player
    - Incident (goal, yellow card etc.)
  - Secondary things:
    - Team
    - Competition (including sub-competitions e.g. groups in a tournament)

We'll whisper it quietly, but these are based around structured data. This is something that SBN fails at, hard. There's tentative steps around it, but it's obviously not loved. Which is a shame, because it could be used as a key anchoring strength of their whole approach. It's not necessarily something you'd shout about, but it is a philosophy and principle that underpins everything. And importantly, these are the building blocks of narrative, not just numbers and stats. Each number, each incident, each thing, has a story around it, potentially.

## Community is what matters.
this is where SBN's strength lies - they have a small but high quality number of main contributors to a fan site, who essentially moderate it, keeping a fan-view on things, but also with intelligence and humour. The comments may be a bear pit, but the main content is good.

So, the 'facts' of the thing are the core, and the community/content is what circles around it.

## Shared spaces, different viewpoints.
Again, something that SBN has taken some tentative steps towards, but I think is crucial (especially when thinking forward into news) - currently you'd have separate fan sites, so they will have separate instances of the same match, the same goal etc. What you want is both these places for more 'safe' conversation, but then a shared space where people can see different viewpoints etc. Obviously again this is fraught with danger of aggression, but here's where it needs good community managers to oversee it.

Other things to note:

I like the idea of visualising stats over time. Often you'll get a heat map or just two percentages of posession at the end of the match, but what about charting it over time, so you see each time rise/fall throughout a match.

Similarly in the shared space, there's something about the colours of the teams battling for control of the background.

On a match page, the primary things would be the facts - teams, score, incidents, and then you'd have a row per incident, which would gradually be filled with content. So everything is organised around the Things.

For a goal, for instance, any kind of video/picture of the goal probably has primacy (aside from the facts, again - which match, who scored, when), then you will have analysis from pundits, fan reactions, manager/player reactions.

this isn't just about the live experience - if anything it's more about post-match and history, giving fans the anchors to hang conversations off. Live experience (and particularly the build up) should be thought about too.

Then of course you have team, competition and player pages, where different narratives outside of any one match exist. But those narratives are invariably made up of what happens on the pitch.
